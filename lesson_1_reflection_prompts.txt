What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Git is more efficent and clear to solve the problems (with detailed report of changes)

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    
Because Git is studied for optimize the works of the programmers, Google Docs no. The programs are made in more function or parts, and all of those can be modified in relational mode. Here born the necessity to save all file used in one commit action.
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

I copy  (ctrl + shift +ins)

 the id code of the first and second id (more recent file is below the first id)

 and i execute git diff 
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    
Version Control permit control on the release and downgreadable if necessary
